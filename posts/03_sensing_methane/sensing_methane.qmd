_This blog offers informed opinions and perspectives relating to nascent technologies in data-centric engineering. Matthew Jones ([Shell](https://www.shell.com/)) and [Philip Jonathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-jonathan-81b3a59/?originalSubdomain=uk) ([Shell](https://www.shell.com/), [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/philip-jonathan)) discuss the importance of monitoring methane to reduce global warming, different sensing technologies, and source location methods for unusual methane signals._

Methane (CH₄) is a key greenhouse gas and absorbs thermal radiation more effectively than carbon dioxide (CO₂). Hence, even though it is much less abundant than CO₂ in the atmosphere, CH₄ still traps about half the overall heat trapped by CO₂. The relatively short lifetime of atmospheric CH₄ also means that any reductions in anthropogenic CH₄ emissions will translate into a more immediate reduction in warming. Measuring atmospheric CH₄ to identify and characterise sources of man-made emissions is therefore of obvious interest. This blog summarises the sensing technologies and inference methods used recently for methane monitoring by us and our colleagues; you can click on the hyperlinks for more information.

# Sensing technologies

There are many CH₄ sensing technologies appropriate for different types of application, at different spatial and temporal scales. On a global scale, spectrometers such as TROPOMI (on ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite) provide column integrated concentration measurements for CH₄ at a ground pixel resolution of around 7×7 km² on a daily basis. For continuous monitoring of emissions from a specific location (like a gas processing facility) of the order of 1 km², optical line-of-sight sensing is a possibility. Various types of point sensors are also available; some of these are cheap to deploy, but this tends to come at the expense of accuracy. Manned aircraft and drone-based optical sensing provide flexible alternatives when continuous monitoring is difficult or not desired.

# Source location

In principle, we can use satellite-based measurements directly to estimate the spatial distribution of CH₄. Line-of-sight sensing is useful for [anomaly detection](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1502), to ensure that no unusual CH₄ signals occur. It is sometimes useful to infer the presence of CH₄ by measuring [other gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12486) whose concentrations are coupled to those of CH₄. If we have enough knowledge about the wind field, we can use remote measurements to triangulate the location of a source, and estimate its characteristics; this process is commonly called [inversion](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086725). Wind field data is used within a dispersion model to describe how CH₄ propagates from the source to the measurement location. Such a model can be very simple (like a [Gaussian plume](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086725)) or more complex (such as a numerical solution to the differential equation describing gas advection and diffusion). Source characteristics and associated uncertainties can be calculated using [Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1409v3); because this can be computationally challenging, we require efficient numerical methods or approximations to achieve it. It is usually necessary to estimate the variation of background CH₄ in space and time as part of the inversion.

Sometimes, especially for satellite monitoring, we can even identify the spatial profile of a CH₄ plume emerging from the source, as in the figure; estimating the source location, in this case, is pretty simple! Sometimes, aircraft gather measurements on helical trajectories around a known source location, at increasing altitudes, and then use a mass balance to estimate the amount of CH₄ emerging from the ground area corresponding to the helix. With the development and deployment of improved CH₄ monitoring technology, from more and higher-resolution satellite-based sensors to cheaper, more accurate point sensors, our ability to quantify atmospheric methane is improving all the time.
