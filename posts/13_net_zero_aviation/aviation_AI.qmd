Next week, Georgia Tech will host the Net-Zero Aviation with AI mini-workshop, a groundbreaking collaboration between industry leaders, academics, trade associations, and government officials. This workshop, funded by the [Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.ae.gatech.edu/) and the [United Kingdom Science & Innovation Network](https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/uk-science-and-innovation-network), reinforces the strong bilateral partnership between the US and the UK. It’s a testament to both nations’ shared commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The aviation sector, uniquely interconnected and global in nature, underscores the importance of such collaboration. After all, policies and actions taken in one corner of the world can ripple across the entire industry.

## AI: A Catalyst for Aviation Sustainability

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an unprecedented opportunity to make aviation more sustainable in the near future. We’re already seeing exciting examples of this in action:

- Google & American Airlines: Google’s AI-powered contrail prediction model helps pilots adjust flight paths, minimizing these heat-trapping clouds.
- Google & Lufthansa Group: Google’s collaboration with Lufthansa Group has resulted in an AI-powered flight planning tool that optimizes routes for maximum fuel efficiency.
- Assaia: This innovative startup uses AI-powered cameras and sensors to monitor airport ground operations, detecting excessive emissions from auxiliary power units (APUs) and helping airlines cut down on unnecessary fuel burn.

These are just a few of the ways AI is being leveraged to make aviation greener. The possibilities are vast, ranging from more accurate carbon emissions calculators to optimizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and even tracking waste from aircraft and airports.

## Small Steps, Big Impact

Even small steps in the right direction, when amplified across fleets and airports worldwide, can lead to significant emissions reductions. The Net-Zero Aviation with AI mini-workshop is a crucial platform for exploring these possibilities and accelerating the industry’s journey towards a sustainable future. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting collaboration!
